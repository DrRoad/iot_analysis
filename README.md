## Important Notes

For those who are not very familiar with git, it is easy to learn the skill with [tryGit](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). Working with GitHub's client will also save your typing in terminal.

It is recommended to switch the notification setting from `Not Watching` to `Watching`. You can find the button at the right of header line.

## General Rules

+ Never do a force push. Even if you have a wrong commit. We can always go back to a previous point.
+ Before push anything to the repository, use `git pull --rebase origin` to update your local source code.
+ Never add data files to the repository. Share them via google drive.
+ Avoid to add binary files (e.g. PDF) and temporary files to repository. Use `.gitignore` to ignore them.
+ Choose your own flavor: direct commit in master branch or commit to your own branch and make a pull request. Personally I recommend the later one but is not mandatory (hard for novice).
+ Discuss problems and share links using `issues` in GitHub website.
+ Welcome to add more rules and other content in README.md!
